  "summary": "Most core UI screens (Home, Catalog, Offers, New Arrivals, Contact, Product Details) plus WhatsApp ordering and React Query data fetching are implemented. However, the backend does not appear to seed any initial catalog data, so the app will render empty lists end-to-end unless data is manually added. The diff also shows changes in frontend paths that were specified as immutable in the constraints.",

      "id": "REQ-7",
      "requirement": "App functions end-to-end with seeded backend data without requiring manual data entry (catalog/products including offer/new-arrival markers persisted and served from the single Motoko backend actor).",
      "reason": "The backend initializes an empty Map of sarees and exposes query methods, but there is no evidence of any seeded/initialized product data being inserted on actor init (or persisted stable state with seed fallback). As written, getAllSarees/getOffers/getNewArrivals will return empty arrays until addSaree is called manually.",
